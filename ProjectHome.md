Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities. These activities, called 'explorations', simulate a one-on-one conversation with an intelligent tutor. You can try a hosted version at <b><a href='https://www.oppia.org'>Oppia.org</a></b>.<br>
<br>
<h4>Bite-Size</h4>

Explorations are easy to create and quick to play. They can be published in the exploration gallery, shared on social media, or embedded on your webpage.<br>
<br>
<h4>Interactive</h4>

Oppia supports 'learning by doing'. Your exploration can include embedded code editors, dynamic world maps, and many other options for interaction.<br>
<br>
<h4>Adaptive</h4>

Feedback is an essential part of learning. The branching nature of Oppia allows you to respond to mistakes and address misconceptions as learners progress through an exploration.<br>

<br>
You can download the developers' version of Oppia using git by following the instructions on our <a href='GettingStarted.md'>Getting Started</a> page. Alternatively, you can download the latest stable release as a <a href='https://oppia.googlecode.com/archive/v2.0.0.rc.2.zip'>zip file</a> (v2.0.0.rc.2, updated 24 Apr 2015).<br>
<br>
