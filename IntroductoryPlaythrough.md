# Exploring Oppia on the Test Server #

This page gives a walkthrough of the different parts of Oppia. You can also explore Oppia alongside this guide by following along on our [test server](https://oppiatestserver.appspot.com/explore/0), or by [downloading and installing your own copy of Oppia](GettingStarted.md).

# The Main Page #

When you visit Oppia, you'll see the following splash page:

Oppia is designed to simulate a conversation. Here, the computer is asking you where the word 'Oppia' comes from. Let's make a guess by clicking one of the answers.<br>
<br>

We selected the second option: <i>It's a nonsense word that someone made up.</i>

<img src='http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/splash3.png' width='1000'>

Apparently, it isn't! We now need to guess what language it is. Latin, perhaps?<br>
<br>
<img src='http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/splash4.png' width='1000'>

So it's not Latin. But instead of the standard "wrong answer, try again", we get a rather nicely customized response! Did Oppia spontaneously generate this all by itself?<br>
<br>
Actually, no, it's not as clever as that. This response was entered by a human: the creator of the exploration. The reason it got entered at all was because it was a response that many readers were giving. These responses are bubbled to the top of a list (as we'll see later) which makes it easy for the exploration creator to make improvements that have the greatest impact.<br>
<br>
We'll leave you alone to continue playing with the exploration for now. If you carry on a bit (the origin of Oppia is from <i>Finnish</i>, by the way), you'll see that Oppia does go beyond multiple-choice and textual input: at a later point, you'll be shown a map and will be able to answer a question by pointing to a location on that map.<br>
<br>
If you ever want to try a different path through the exploration, you can click the "restart" button in the upper-right at any time.<br>
<br>
Take your time to explore! When you're done, click on the 'Gallery' tab on the navigation bar at the top.<br>
<br>
<h1>The Exploration Gallery</h1>

The exploration gallery is a catalog of explorations classified by category (so you can find all the mathematics explorations in one place, all the geography explorations in one place, and so on).<br>
<br>
<img src='http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/gallery.png' width='1000'>

You can select additional categories from the dropdown menus at the top to filter the search results. For example, selecting the 'Geograph' category will allow you to see all the explorations teaching something related to mathematics that are published on the server. You can start playing any of these by clicking on its title.<br>
<br>
<h1>Next Steps</h1>

You've now seen what Oppia looks like from the reader point of view. If you have any thoughts so far or find any issues (and are playing on our demo server), do let us know by going to about on the top menu bar, and clicking on contact. Then, follow the instructions on that page.<br>
<br>
The next step is to create your own explorations. You can do this either on your own machine, or on the demo server.<br>
<ul><li>If you want to do this on your own machine, you will need to <a href='GettingStarted.md'>download and install</a> a local copy of Oppia.<br>
</li><li>If you want to do this on the demo server, you will need to log in (this is because we need to know who is allowed to edit which explorations). After you do so, you will have access to more options; in particular, you will be able to copy the existing explorations and create new ones.</li></ul>

When you've done either of these, proceed to <a href='PlanningYourExploration.md'>Planning Your Exploration</a>.
