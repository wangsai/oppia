# The Learner View of an Exploration #

The Oppia learner view is meant to simulate a chat conversation, with the difference being that the learner can respond in a lot of different ways: they can write a proof, enter a number, click on a map, and so on.

The following screenshot shows the start of the "Pitch Perfect" demo exploration, where Oppia gives an introduction, and then offers the learner a music staff on which they can drag and drop notes to match the desired sequence.

Based on the learner's response, Oppia will give the learner hints or ask further questions, as appropriate.<br>

<h2>Additional options ##

It's also possible to do a number of other things on this page:

### Giving feedback ###

The learner can give feedback on any card of the exploration (or on the whole exploration by clicking the feedback tab in the top-right). This feedback will be shown in the feedback tab of the editor page for that exploration, and will add a notification to the "My Explorations" dashboards of the exploration editors.

<h3>Rating the exploration ###

When the learner finishes playing the exploration, they are given the option to rate it:

After at least 5 ratings have been received, the average rating for the exploration will be shown in the gallery.<br>

<h3>Sharing and embedding ###

Explorations can be shared on social media via the 'Share' tab on the top right of the page. This tab also includes an option to [embed explorations](EmbeddingYourExploration.md) in other courses or web pages.
