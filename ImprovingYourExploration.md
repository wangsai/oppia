# Improve the exploration #

One of the main features of Oppia explorations is that they can be incrementally improved over time, and we are hoping to make this feature even better as time progresses.

If you want to improve an exploration, one starting point is to take a look at the answers that readers submitted. To view these, click on the "Exploration Stats" tab in the exploration editor. If any reader has viewed your exploration, you should see a page like this one:

This shows the number of times your exploration has been completed, and gives a breakdown of how often each state was reached, how often each rule for a given state was hit, and the different answers that were given by readers.<br>
<br>
You can use this information to make your exploration better. For example, you could identify a state in which a particular answer was submitted many times, which might suggest that a new rule should be created for this answer. Or you might see that a question is getting very few correct answers, which might suggest that it is unclear.<br>

To edit a particular state, you can click the state name in the left-hand column of the table to jump directly to that state's editor.
