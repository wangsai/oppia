# State Editor: Non-interactive content #

Non-interactive content is content that is shown to the reader, but that does not invite the reader to respond in a way that Oppia can provide feedback to. For example, a YouTube video is one possible type of non-interactive content. However, although the reader can fast-forward the video, skip to the end, or press the play/pause buttons, none of this input is regarded as a communication from the reader to Oppia. Thus, no state transitions are possible here, and the content provided here will simply be displayed to the reader.

Currently, non-interactive content can be entered via the rich-text editor, as shown below:
