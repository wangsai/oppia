One of the ways people learn is by doing stuff. You don’t typically learn to play the piano by reading a book on how to play the piano, or listening to 12 hours of lectures by someone telling you how to play the piano. Most people learn how to play the piano by actually playing it, getting feedback from a different person (or their own ears), gradually correcting mistakes and improving their technique, and thus getting better through a continuous, formative cycle of ‘doing’.

The Internet has made it easier than ever before for people to help other people learn. However, most of the tools available to do this take the form of one-way communication: a page of text, or a recorded video. There don’t seem to be many tools available that make it easy for great teachers to create engaging, feedback-rich experiences for others without writing a program or a web app.

Oppia tries to alleviate this by making it possible for non-technical users to create interactive educational explorations that understand and give feedback to their readers. Such explorations are similar to one-on-one student/teacher conversations, and require the participation of the reader, much like a video game does. This makes a well-designed exploration likely to be more engaging and effective, because the reader gets to participate actively.

Creating good explorations with Oppia is more work than writing an equivalent page of text, because the reader's answers have to be accounted for: the richer the feedback and the more tailored it is to the individual reader's response, the better the quality of the conversation. Thus, one of Oppia's aims is to make explorations easily improvable over time, and to enable the collaborative creation and editing of explorations by students and teachers alike, so that the world can benefit from them.
