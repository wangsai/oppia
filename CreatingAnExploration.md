# Creating an Exploration #

After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To do so, navigate to the gallery, and look for the "Create Exploration" button in the top navbar.

This will open a dialog box. You'll need to specify four things:<br>
<br>
<ul><li><b>A title.</b> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys the essence of your exploration.<br>
</li><li><b>A goal.</b> What is the exploration supposed to help the player learn?<br>
</li><li><b>A category.</b> You can select one of the predefined categories, or define your own.<br>
</li><li><b>A language.</b> This is the language that your exploration is written in. (In the special case of explorations that teach languages, this should be the language that the exploration is written in, not the language that the exploration is trying to teach.)</li></ul>

Once you've done that, click the green button in the bottom right. This will create a new exploration with the properties you've specified.<br>
